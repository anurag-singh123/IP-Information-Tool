## Customization
- **Change the API**: By default, this tool uses the `ipinfo.io` API. If you want to use a different API, update the `get_ip_info` function in `IPInformationTool.py` with the relevant API URL and data parsing logic.
- **Styling**: The toolâ€™s appearance can be customized by tweaking the `tkinter` styles (colors, fonts, etc.) within the script.
